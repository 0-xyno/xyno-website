      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey there! I'm Koko, a quantum thinker with a passion for coding and physics. I absolutely love diving into the mysteries of the universe, especially when it comes to quantum physics. If you ask me, "Why physics?" the answer is simple: because the universe is full of endless puzzles that’ll never stop fascinating me! 💫

        When I’m not coding or crunching numbers, you’ll probably find me experimenting with new theories (even if some of those theories are just random thoughts in my head, haha). 😜 But honestly, I believe every line of code I write is like a mini simulation of our world, and who knows, maybe it could lead to a huge breakthrough someday! 🚀
        
        Oh, and I also have this weird hobby of mixing quantum physics with humor. I don’t know why, but in my mind, quantum entanglement is kind of like the feeling you get when you meet someone cool — connected without even realizing it! 😏 (But shhh, I’m totally serious about this one, haha!) 🤫
        
        Bottom line: when I’m coding or learning something new, I always think, “Physics can make the world more fun, if you know how to look at it!”.</p>
